<div id="title">Using the Anapnean VPN (Windows)</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    To start with, we're going to download three things:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html">the OpenVPN client</a> (choose the "Windows installer")</li>
      <li><a href="anapnea.ovpn">a configuration file for the client</a></li>
      <li><a href="anapnea.crt">and Anapnea's CA certificate</a></li>
    </ul>
    You may wish to verify the integrity of these files (see a <a href="../putty_connecting">SSH connecting article</a> for more information on why this is important).
    An easy way to ensure that the Anapnean configuration and certificate files have not been tampered with is to download them using
    SFTP (SSH is much harder to intercept than HTTP). Download them using a <a href="../filezilla">SFTP client</a> from the
    <code>/var/www/tutorials/windows_openvpn/</code> folder.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Install the OpenVPN software, and then copy the two files you downloaded, <code>anapnea.ovpn</code> and <code>anapnea.crt</code> into
    the <code>C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config</code> directory, as shown below.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Okay, now let's connect. Click on the OpenVPN GUI shortcut on your desktop or in the OpenVPN folder in the Applications menu.
    No application window will open, however, an icon will appear in the notification area. Right click it, and select connect.
  </div>

    <img src="images/2.png" alt="OpenVPN shortcut" />
    <img src="images/3.png" alt="OpenVPN notification area menu open, connect selected" />
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    OpenVPN will ask you for your username and password. These are the same credentials you use
    to log into SSH.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Eventually you should see the following:
  </div>

    <img src="images/5.png" alt="OpenVPN log window after connecting" />
    <img src="images/6.png" alt="OpenVPN notification bubble after connecting" />
  </div>

  <div>
    This means you are connected! All of your traffic to the internet and your LAN is
    completely unaffected, however, you can now communicate with other Anapnea users
    that are connected to the VPN. All Anapnea VPN IP addresses begin with
    <code>10.0.8</code>. In this example, I've been given IP <code>10.0.8.2</code>.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    You can disconnect and reconnect by right clicking the OpenVPN icon in the notification area,
    and if you close or restart all you need to do to reconnect is to open the OpenVPN GUI,
    right click, and connect.
