<div id="title">Tunneling</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    This guide assumes you are using Windows and have already set up PuTTY to connect. <a href='../putty_connecting'>If not, have a look here</a>.
    Don't worry linux or mac users, tunneling is so rediculously simple there it doesn't need <a href='../unix_ssh'>so much of a guide</a>.
  </div>

  <div><img src="images/1.png" alt="Picture of PuTTY main config screen, ready to connect to anapnea.net." \></div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Navigate to the Tunnels configuration page, and add a new dynamic tunnel on port 9090.
    The port you use doesn't actually matter, however for this example we'll use 9090.
    If you can't use 9090, you must remember to use the same port here as you do later.
  </div>

  <div><img src="images/2.png" alt="Choose Connection, SSH, Tunnels. Put 9090 in Source Port, choose the Dynamic option, and click Add." \></div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Verify that the Tunnels page now looks like this. The important bit is D9090 in the list.
    Now that you've added it, click Open and connect as you would normally do.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Having connected, you are now tunneling over SSH. You need to leave this window open the whole time while you browse, since PuTTY is keeping the tunnel open.
  </div>

</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Clicking on Settings in Internet Explorer, or Proxy Settings in Google Chrome, should open this dialogue.
    Navigate through to the Advanced Proxy section and add localhost:9090 as a SOCKS Proxy.
  </div>

  <div>

    <img src="images/6.png" alt="Picture of LAN Settings dialogue, choose Advanced" \>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Finally, you may like to use a website that tells you your ip address, in order to verify that tunneling is working correctly.
    We have hosted <a href='check.php'>a small file</a> that will verify that you are tunneling your browsing through anapnea.
  </div>
